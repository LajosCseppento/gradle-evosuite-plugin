# gradle-evosuite-plugin

Gradle plugin for generating tests using [EvoSuite](http://www.evosuite.org/).

> EvoSuite automatically generates JUnit test suites for Java classes, targeting 
> code coverage criteria such as branch coverage. It uses an evolutionary 
> approach based on a genetic algorithm to derive test suites. To improve 
> readability, the generated unit tests are minimized, and regression assertions 
> that capture the current behavior of the tested classes are added to the tests.
